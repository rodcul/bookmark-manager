  # Strictly speaking, the tests that check the UI

  # that check what we have in the DB. The reason is that
  # you should test one thing at a time, whereas
  # by mixing the two we're testing both
  # the business logic and the views.
  #
  # However, let's not worry about this yet
  # to keep the example simple.
